First ran file, saw it was raw bytes so then I ran strings and saw there was a Hello.py in there

This indicated I needed to maybe get the file from within it. Did not know how to proceed so I googled the first few bytes of the file to see if it returned any hits.

It did, I came across [this](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/24835/decompiling-pyc-file-to-0-byte-py-file)

It recommended I use the tool uncompyle6. I pip installed and then tried passing the file through. Changed the file to a .pyc so that way the program would understand it.

Once decompiled I piped the output into itâ€™s own python script. Here is the code returned  

```python
def main(input):
    j = -4
    for c in input:
        if j == 1:
            if c != 'Z':
                exit(43)
            else:

Basically it would check the values of input and then traverse the conditions until the string matched. I was quickly able to notice that just following the values of j from -7 to 10 would resolve to be the flag so I quickly manually wrote down the values to come up with the flag.  
-7 = w  
-6 = t  
-5 = f  
-4 = C  
-3 = T  
-2 = F  
-1 = {  
0  = 3  
1  = Z  
2  = _  
3  = R  
4  = 3  
5  = V  
6  = E  
7  = R  
8  = 5  
9  = 3  
10 = }  

`flag = wtfCTF{3Z_R3VER53}`
